## üîß Installation and Setup

1. Set up a workspace directory:
```
This app uses concurrently to run the frontend and backend in the same terminal.
Clone both the frontend and backend repository into this folder
```

2. Clone the repositories:
```
cd workspace
git clone https://github.com/AdamarArcane/d2-loot-frontend
git clone https://github.com/AdamarArcane/d2-loot-backend
```

3. Set up the frontend:
```
cd d2-loot-frontend
npm install
```

4. Set up the backend:
```
cd ../d2-loot-backend
go mod tidy
```

5. Create your app on the [Bungie dev site](https://bungie.net/en/application) for OAuth2:
```
Both of your ports need to serve over an HTTPS connection for Bungie authentication.
The frontend is taken care of for you with makecert but you will need to figure out the backend.
I used [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)!
Your app should be set to private with private authentication.
Make sure that your callback link exactly matches your backend link (could be ngrok).
```

6. Set up enviorment variables (create your own .env file):
```
// frontend
VITE_FRONTEND_URL=https://localhost:5173
VITE_BACKEND_URL=
```
```
// backend
PORT="8080"
FRONTEND_DOMAIN="localhost:5173"
BACKEND_DOMAIN=
DATABASE_URL=
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECRET=
REDIRECT_URL=
SESSION_KEY=
ENCRYPTION_KEY =
API_KEY=
```

7. Start the development server:
```
cd d2-loot-frontend
npm run start
```

8. Open `https://localhost:5173` in your browser.
